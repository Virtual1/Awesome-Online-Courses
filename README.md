# AWESOME Online Courses
[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.svg)](https://gitter.im/p2pu/AwesomeOnlineCourses)


[Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU)](https://www.p2pu.org) supports high-quality learning opportunities beyond institutional walls. We're currently working with libraries and community groups to facilitate peer-led learning circles for people who want to take online courses together and in-person.


**WE NEED YOUR HELP** to find more **AWESOME** online courses and share this list with educators and facilitators who are running learning circles around the globe.

## What are Learning Circles?

[Learning circles](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/) are lightly-facilitated study groups for people who want to take free
online courses together at a library or community center. Meeting once a week for 6-8 weeks, participants work together through course materials as diverse as the internet itself, including resume writing, web design, and public speaking. The facilitator of a learning circle is not expected to be a content expert - their role is to be proficient in online courseware and skilled in facilitating peer learning groups.

## Why Learning Circles?

There is a huge volume of free, high-quality learning courses available online, but completion rates for online learning hover around 5%, and those who do complete a course are often already highly educated. Due to barriers like **digital literacy, awareness, and academic
confidence**, many of the individuals who stand to gain the most from online learning are not currently taking part. Learning circles offer an opportunity for **first-time online learners** meaningfully engage with course materials, and provide peer-to-peer support to help each other succeed. They also support the development of digital skills, and help create face-to-face community around shared interests. Learning circles usually meet for 90 minutes/week for 6 weeks with between 4-12 participants, though this model is flexible. If you would like more information on how learning circles are run, take a look through our [facilitator handbook](https://www.p2pu.org/assets/uploads/learning_circle_downloads/facilitator_handbook.pdf). 



## What makes an AWESOME Online Course?

There are thousands of online courses to choose from, but we find that ver few are AWESOME. Online learning is truly awesome when it meets the learner's **skills, knowledge, context, interests** and is **accessible**. Being that many of our learners are not interested in Ruby on Rails, iOS App Development...  

An Awesome Course is...
* Free (free enrolment and free access to all course materials)
* Openly licensed (rather than copyrighted)
* Available on-demand
* Not too long (semester long courses can be very daunting for learners and facilitators)
* Modular / adaptable to different interests

An Awesome Course has...
* Activities that make sense being done together as group work
* Enough materials that a group could work through them over the course of 6 weeks
* No additional software requirements aside from a internet browser and text editor
* An intuitive user experience

To give you a sense of some of the types of courses we're looking for, our most popular courses that are run as learning circles are: *Intro to HTML and CSS; Resume Writing; Beginner's Guide to Academic Writing; Introduction to Computer Science; Finance for Everyone: Smart Tools for Decision-Making; Fundamentals of Public Speaking; The Science of Happiness; Start Writing Fiction; Career Edge: Resume, Networking and Interview Skills; English Now! USA Learns; Make a Website.*
